If you are using these codes as a learning resource, I suggest you proceed in
this order:
(1) RBC.py
(2) EGM.py
(3) Aiyagari.py
(4a) Reiter.py
(4b) MITshocks.py

Note that the later programs import code and results from the earlier programs.
Therefore, if you are tinkering with the programs, you may want to make copies
first.

Computing environment:
Here are the version numbers, for the environment in which I developed the code
Python version 3.6.5
Python modules:
  autograd==1.2
  matplotlib==2.2.2
  scipy==1.1.0
