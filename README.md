# Macro in Python

These notebooks contain my (amateur) approach to solve macroeconomic models using Python. The code is not written for being elegant, neither for speed, therefore, optimization is needed and comments are welcome. I only code to learn the concepts and make first experience with solving these models.

A large part of the code is based on two resources:
- Introduction to computational economics using fortran by Fehr and Kindermann, 2018
- Jo√£o B. Duarte's Ph.D. course on Macro in Python (https://github.com/jbduarte/Advanced_Macro)

I am currently working on a solution to the stochastic growth model. Further projects include:

- The simple RBC model
- RBC with flexible capacity utilization
- Aiyagari model
- Replication of Aiyagari mit zwei States as im Krusell and Smith (2006)
- Checking the model in it's toy version for approximate aggregation
- Two action programming (check fortran)
- Krusell Smith mit two idiosyncratic shocks as in Krusell and Smith (2007)
- Krusell and Smith normal and the comparison with RBC
- Krusell Smith with flexible labour supply
- Two period example as in Krusell and Smith to solve for model with correlated volatility
- Krusell and Smith with two assets as in Bayer et al. (2019)
- The two assets Krusell adn Smith model with aggregate and individual uncertainty which is correlated
- Blanchard et al. (2011) Bayesian DSGE with three shocks to productivity
- Life-Cycle Simulation
- Estimating a DSGE using likelihood methods
- Simulated method of moments
