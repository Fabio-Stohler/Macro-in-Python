Solution of Macroeconomic Models in Python

These spyder-files contain my (amateur) approach to solve macroeconomic models using Python. The code is not written for being elegant, neither for speed, therefore, optimization is needed and comments are welcome. I only code to learn the concepts and make first experience with solving these models.

A large part of the code is based on two resources:

    Introduction to computational economics using fortran by Fehr and Kindermann, 2018
    Jo√£o B. Duarte's Ph.D. course on Macro in Python (https://github.com/jbduarte/Advanced_Macro)
    Recursive Macroeconomic Theory by Sargent and Ljungqvist, 2012
    Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling by Herr and Maussner, 2009

I am currently working on a solution to Krusell and Smith (1998). Currently the codes include:

    Simple stochastic growth model (Value function iteration and Howard improvement algorithm)
    Simple RBC model with labor choice (Value function iteration and Howard improvement algorithm)
    Aiyagari model with different aggregation types
